### Welcome to your new assignment!

You are a Cloud Consultant who is beginning an assignment at *Unicorn Reservoir Characterization (URC)* * a new tool for geological analysis that "will change how much your rocks rock!"

In this session, you will meet with the *URC* team, and design a scalable architecture that meets their requirements.
What are their requirements? What will this system do? How does the data go from a rock to a data science notebook?

Well, to answer those questions, you simply have to show up and ask them.

In this session, you will be an Architect responsible to translating business requirements to technical requirements, white boarding out an architectural diagram, and then figuring out how to take your great ideas and translate them into actionable next steps.

In this session, you'll meet some of the key stakeholders at *URC*, learn about their goals, and design a system to meet their vision of "Being the Rock Stars of the Reservoir Characterization World"  

* *Note  that Unicorn Reservoir Characterization (URC) is a fictitious company and any overlap with real companies and products is purely coincidental*


### Learning Objectives
* Understand the basics of translating business requirements to technical requirements
* Knowledge about key AWS Services and where to learn more
* Techniques for whiteboarding successfully
* What the AWS Well-Architected Framework is and how to use it
* How to take those great ideas and architecture and do something with them

### Background
Data engineering and systems architecture is a necessary precursor to delivering data-driven subsurface insights. As a geologist or geophysicist, systems design typically isnâ€™t something you learn in school, yet it can be a necessary skill set to progress your career and drive meaningful change.

### Session Overview
This session will present an overview of the key concepts and design principles for building a scalable and cloud-optimized infrastructure in line with the AWS Well-Architected Framework, with a specific focus on Energy-Industry use cases and accompanying challenges for subsurface professionals. Attendees will leave this session with techniques for outlining technical requirements, knowledge of key AWS services and solutions, an overview of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, and an understanding of how to design for scalable and resilient solutions that can be implemented to improve subsurface workflows.

### Agenda
* Working backwards: User stories to drive technical requirements
* Services, solutions, and scalability
* Whiteboarding as a superpower
* The AWS Well-Architected Framework
* Now what? How to communicate and drive architectural improvements
