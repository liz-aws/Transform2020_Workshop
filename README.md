### Welcome to your new assignment!

You are a Cloud Consultant who is beginning an assignment at *Unicorn Reservoir Charachterization (URC)* a new tool for geological analysis that "will change how much your rocks rock!"

In this session, you will meet with the *URC* team, and design a scalable arcitecture that meets their requirments.
What are their requirments? What will this system do? How does the data go from a rock to a data science notebook?

Well, to answer those questions, you simply have to show up and ask them.

### Learning Objectives
Understand the basics of translating business requirements to technical requirements
Knowledge about key AWS Services and where to learn more
Techniques for whiteboarding successfully
What the AWS Well-Architected Framework is and how to use it
How to take those great ideas and architecture and do something with them

### Background
Data engineering and systems architecture is a necessary precursor to delivering data-driven subsurface insights. As a geologist or geophysicist, systems design typically isnâ€™t something you learn in school, yet it can be a necessary skill set to progress your career and drive meaningful change.

### Session Overview
This session will present an overview of the key concepts and design principles for building a scalable and cloud-optimized infrastructure in line with the AWS Well-Architected Framework, with a specific focus on Energy-Industry use cases and accompanying challenges for subsurface professionals. Attendees will leave this session with techniques for outlining technical requirements, knowledge of key AWS services and solutions, an overview of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, and an understanding of how to design for scalable and resilient solutions that can be implemented to improve subsurface workflows.

### Agenda
Working backwards: User stories to drive technical requirements
Services, solutions, and scalability
Whiteboarding as a superpower
The AWS Well-Architected Framework
Now what? How to communicate and drive architectural improvements
